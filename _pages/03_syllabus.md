## Course Description {#sec:org10898d5}

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of geographic
information systems (GISystems), geographic information science (GIScience),
and their application to public policy and the social sciences. The course will also provide
instruction in a variety of open source GIS and spatial analysis
software packages including QGIS, PySAL and OpenGeoDa.

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course students will have acquired:

-   A sound understanding of fundamental spatial concepts and theory

-   Know how to locate, import, manipulate, display, and analyze
    geographical data in a GIS

-   Ability to apply GIScience concepts and methods in public policy and
    social science research

## Prerequisites {#sec:orgbb753e4}

Graduate standing or consent of instructor.

## Academic Integrity {#sec:orgde332a6}

The UCR student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic
misconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabbotage,
non-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more
information about the UCR student academic integrity policy, please use

## Disability accommodations

Qualified students with disabilities who will require disability
accommodations in this class are encouraged to make their requests to me
at the beginning of the quarter either during office hours or by
appointment.


**Note**: Prior to receiving disability accommodations,
verification of eligibility from the [Student Disability Resource
Center](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/) is required. Disability information is

## Code of Conduct

As course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free
