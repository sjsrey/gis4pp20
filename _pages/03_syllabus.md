## Course Description {#sec:org10898d5}

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of geographic
information systems (GISystems), geographic information science (GIScience),
and their application to public policy and the social sciences. The course will also provide
instruction in a variety of open source GIS and spatial analysis
software packages including [QGIS](http://qgis.org), [PySAL](http://pysal.org), and [OpenGeoDa](http://geodacenter.github.io/).

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course students will have acquired:

-   A sound understanding of fundamental spatial concepts and theory

-   Know how to locate, import, manipulate, display, and analyze
    geographical data in a GIS

-   Ability to apply GIScience concepts and methods in public policy and
    social science research

## Prerequisites {#sec:orgbb753e4}

Makeups for exams will be given for unforeseen events. Makeups will consist of a 30 minute oral examination during office hours.


#### Collaboration

You have the opportunity to earn a total of 10 collaboration points.
Collaboration here means you make a contribution that improves the course
experience for all.

Points can be earned for the following contributions:

-   An approved review question (1 pt)
-   An approved answer to a review question (1 pt)


#### Review Questions


-   Can be submitted anytime up to 2 weeks before the midterm or final
-   Must be submitted through piazza
-   Have to be approved by the professor for credit

#### Piazza

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.
