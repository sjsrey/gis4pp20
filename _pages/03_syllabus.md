## Course Description {#sec:org10898d5}

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of geographic
information systems (GISystems), geographic information science (GIScience),
and their application to public policy and the social sciences. The course will also provide
instruction in a variety of open source GIS and spatial analysis
software packages including [QGIS](http://qgis.org), [PySAL](http://pysal.org), and [OpenGeoDa](http://geodacenter.github.io/).

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course students will have acquired:

-   A sound understanding of fundamental spatial concepts and theory

-   Know how to locate, import, manipulate, display, and analyze
    geographical data in a GIS

-   Ability to apply GIScience concepts and methods in public policy and
    social science research

## Prerequisites {#sec:orgbb753e4}

Graduate standing or consent of instructor.

### Exercises

- Four exercises will be introduced in class and are to be completed outside of meeting times.
- Collaboration on exercises is encouraged with the understanding that you alone are responsible for mastering the material
- Collaboration is not allowed on the examinations
- Material from the exercises will form the bases of some examination questions

### Exams

A mid-term and final examination will be given in class. Exams are closed-book. Reviews will be held the sessions preceding an exam.

Makeups for exams will be given for unforeseen events. Makeups will consist of a 30 minute oral examination during office hours.


#### Collaboration

You have the opportunity to earn a total of 10 collaboration points.
Collaboration here means you make a contribution that improves the course
experience for all.

Points can be earned for the following contributions:

-   An approved review question (1 pt)
-   An approved answer to a review question (1 pt)


#### Review Questions


-   Can be submitted anytime up to 2 weeks before the midterm or final
-   Must be submitted through piazza
-   Have to be approved by the professor for credit

#### Piazza

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

## Academic Integrity {#sec:orgde332a6}

The UCR student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic
misconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabbotage,
non-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more

## Disability accommodations

Qualified students with disabilities who will require disability
accommodations in this class are encouraged to make their requests to me
at the beginning of the quarter either during office hours or by
appointment.


**Note**: Prior to receiving disability accommodations,
verification of eligibility from the [Student Disability Resource

## Code of Conduct

As course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free

show respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As
a learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in
any form.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in this course.
- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PBPL273.
- Students violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and their violations will be reported to the UCR administration.

This code of conduct is an adaptation of the [SciPy 2018 Code of Conduct](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/299527/648147/index9a04.html).
